## Overview

All Evals API endpoints follow consistent conventions for response formats, status codes, and error handling. This page documents what to expect when making requests to the API.

## Response Format

All API responses follow a consistent JSON structure:

### Success response

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    // Response payload specific to the endpoint
  },
  "deprecated": false,
  "link": "https://app.confident-ai.com/..."
}
```

| Field        | Type    | Description                                                                                 |
| ------------ | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `success`    | boolean | Always `true` for successful requests                                                       |
| `data`       | object  | The response payload, varies by endpoint                                                    |
| `deprecated` | boolean | Indicates if this endpoint is deprecated. If `true`, migrate to the recommended alternative |
| `link`       | string  | (Optional) URL to the created/relevant resource on the Confident AI platform                |

### Error response

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Error message describing what went wrong",
  "deprecated": false
}
```

| Field        | Type    | Description                                   |
| ------------ | ------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `success`    | boolean | Always `false` for error responses            |
| `error`      | string  | A human-readable message describing the error |
| `deprecated` | boolean | Indicates if this endpoint is deprecated      |

## HTTP Status Codes

The Evals API uses standard HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure of requests.

### Success codes

| Status Code   | Description                             |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `200 OK`      | The request was successful              |
| `201 Created` | A new resource was successfully created |

### Client error codes

| Status Code | Name                 | Description                                                                                                                   |
| ----------- | -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `400`       | Bad Request          | The request was malformed or contained invalid parameters. Check your request body and query parameters.                      |
| `401`       | Unauthorized         | Authentication failed. Verify your API key is correct and included in the request headers.                                    |
| `403`       | Forbidden            | You don't have permission to access this resource. Check your API key permissions and project access.                         |
| `404`       | Not Found            | The requested resource doesn't exist. Verify the resource ID or path is correct.                                              |
| `409`       | Conflict             | The request conflicts with the current state of the resource. This often occurs when creating a resource that already exists. |
| `422`       | Unprocessable Entity | The request was well-formed but contains semantic errors. Check that your data meets all validation requirements.             |

### Server error codes

| Status Code | Name                  | Description                                                                                                                            |
| ----------- | --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `500`       | Internal Server Error | An unexpected error occurred on our servers. If this persists, contact support.                                                        |
| `503`       | Maintenance           | The API is temporarily unavailable due to scheduled maintenance. Check our [status page](https://status.confident-ai.com) for updates. |

## Ensure Forward Compatibility

**We may add new fields to the `data` field of API responses at any time without considering it a breaking change.**

To ensure your integration remains stable, **your client should ignore unknown fields** rather than failing when encountering them.

For example, if today an endpoint returns:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "testRunId": "abc123"
  },
  "deprecated": false
}
```

And tomorrow it returns:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "testRunId": "abc123",
    "newField": "some value"
  },
  "deprecated": false
}
```

Your client should continue to work without modification. Most JSON parsing libraries handle this by default, but be cautious if you're using strict schema validation.

<Tip>
  When deserializing responses, configure your parser to ignore unknown
  properties. In Python with Pydantic, use `extra = "ignore"`. In TypeScript,
  avoid strict object type assertions.
</Tip>

## Deprecation Notices

When an endpoint is deprecated, responses will include `"deprecated": true`. We recommend:

1. Monitor the `deprecated` field in all responses
2. Plan to migrate to the recommended alternative before the endpoint is removed

<Warning>
  Deprecated endpoints will continue to function for a transition period, but
  may be removed in future API versions. Always migrate to recommended
  alternatives when you see deprecation notices.
</Warning>
