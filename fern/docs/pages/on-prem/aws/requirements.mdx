description: Technologies and resource requirements for Confident AI on AWS
---

Review the following requirements with your infrastructure and security teams before starting deployment.

## Technologies

The following technologies require approval in your environment:

| Technology                    | Version | Purpose                               |
| ----------------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **PostgreSQL**                | 15.x    | Primary database (via AWS RDS)        |
| **Redis**                     | 7.x     | Session cache and job queues          |
| **Kubernetes**                | 1.28+   | Container orchestration (via AWS EKS) |
| **Node.js**                   | 20.x    | Backend and frontend runtime          |
| **Python**                    | 3.11+   | Evaluations service runtime           |
| **Terraform**                 | 1.5+    | Infrastructure provisioning           |
| **Helm**                      | 3.x     | Kubernetes package management         |
| **External Secrets Operator** | 0.9+    | Secrets sync from AWS Secrets Manager |

## Resource allocation

Default resource configurations for staging and production environments:

| Resource            | Staging                      | Production                     |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **EKS Nodes**       | 2x `m6i.large` (2 vCPU, 8GB) | 3x `m6i.xlarge` (4 vCPU, 16GB) |
| **EKS Autoscaling** | 1-4 nodes                    | 2-8 nodes                      |
| **RDS Instance**    | `db.t4g.large` (2 vCPU, 8GB) | `db.m6g.large` (2 vCPU, 8GB)   |
| **RDS Storage**     | 20GB (max 100GB)             | 50GB (max 500GB)               |
| **Bastion Host**    | `t3.micro`                   | `t3.micro`                     |

<Tip>
  These are starting recommendations. Monitor resource usage after deployment
  and scale based on your workload. The evals service is typically the most
  resource-intensive during evaluation runs.
</Tip>

## AWS services

The deployment provisions the following AWS services:

| Service             | Purpose                                      |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **VPC**             | Isolated network with public/private subnets |
| **EKS**             | Managed Kubernetes control plane and nodes   |
| **RDS**             | Managed PostgreSQL database                  |
| **S3**              | Object storage for application data          |
| **Secrets Manager** | Secure credential storage                    |
| **ACM**             | SSL/TLS certificate management               |
| **ALB**             | Application load balancer                    |
| **EC2**             | Bastion host instance                        |
| **IAM**             | Roles and policies for IRSA                  |
| **KMS**             | Encryption keys for secrets and storage      |

## IAM permissions

The deploying user/role needs permissions to create and manage:

- VPC, subnets, route tables, gateways
- EKS clusters and node groups
- RDS instances and subnet groups
- S3 buckets and policies
- IAM roles, policies, and OIDC providers
- Secrets Manager secrets
- ACM certificates
- EC2 instances and security groups

<Note>
  For initial deployment, `AdministratorAccess` simplifies setup. Restrict
  permissions after successful deployment based on your organization's policies.
