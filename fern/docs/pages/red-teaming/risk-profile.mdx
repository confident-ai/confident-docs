## Overview

The risk profile page is where you view all past risk assessments and get insights into your AI application's most critical vulnerabilities, risk issues, and assessment pass rates.

<Tip>

Each risk assessment shows key metrics including CVSS score, vulnerability coverage, attack surface, and remediation priority. The following sections explain each metric.

## Key Metrics

### CVSS score

The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) is an industry-standard framework for measuring vulnerability severity. It provides a numerical score from 0.0 to 10.0:

| Score      | Severity |
| ---------- | -------- |
| 0.0        | None     |
| 0.1 – 3.9  | Low      |
| 4.0 – 6.9  | Medium   |
| 7.0 – 8.9  | High     |
| 9.0 – 10.0 | Critical |

The score is calculated based on exploitability and impact to confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Higher scores signal vulnerabilities that should be prioritized.

### Remediation priority

A classification indicating the urgency of addressing a vulnerability, ranging from P0 (critical) to P4 (low). You can assign remediation priorities to specific vulnerabilities on the platform to help your team triage findings.

- P0 — critical issues requiring immediate remediation
- P1 — high-priority issues to address soon
- P2 — medium-priority issues for planned remediation
- P3 — low-priority issues for deferred mitigation
- P4 — informational findings

### Vulnerability coverage

Vulnerability coverage represents the breadth of your assessment — how many distinct vulnerability categories were evaluated. Higher coverage means the system was tested across a wider range of risk domains.

Maintaining high coverage ensures your AI application is evaluated across diverse risk categories rather than a limited subset.

### Attack surface

The attack surface is the total set of input vectors, interfaces, and interaction pathways through which a model can be influenced or exploited.

A larger attack surface increases potential exposure if not properly secured. Reducing and tightly controlling the attack surface helps limit opportunities for exploitation.

## Test Cases

Each risk assessment generates a set of adversarial test cases. The test cases section displays every attack that was run against your AI application.

Each test case includes:

- Input — the adversarial prompt generated based on a specific vulnerability and attack, sent to your AI application
- Output — the response your AI application produced
- Vulnerability — the vulnerability tested (e.g., Bias, BFLA, BOLA)
- Vulnerability type — the specific type within the vulnerability (e.g., for Bias: gender, race, religion)
- Attack method — the adversarial technique used to enhance the base attack (e.g., Roleplay, Linear Jailbreaking)

Each test case has a status of `passed`, `failed`, or `errored`. A `failed` status means your AI application generated an unsafe response to the adversarial input.
