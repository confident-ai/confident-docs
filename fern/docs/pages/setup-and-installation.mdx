## Overview

To use Confident AI, you will need to setup initially through DeepEval, our open-source SDK for running LLM evals. You'll need to:

- Create a free account
- Login with your Confident API key in DeepEval

## Login with your API key

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Install DeepEval">
        At the root of your project directory, install `deepeval`:
        
        ```bash
        pip install -U deepeval
        ```

      </Step>
      <Step title="Create an account">
        Navigate to [app.confident-ai.com](https://app.confident-ai.com) and create a free account. Once logged in, you'll be able to access your **project** API key from the dashboard.

      </Step>

            <Step title="Set API key as env variable">
        Set your project API key as an environment variable:

        ```bash
        export CONFIDENT_API_KEY="confident_us..."
        ```

        Alternatively, you can login directly using DeepEval:

        ```bash
        deepeval login
        ```

        This will prompt you to enter your API key and save it locally.

      <Step title="Install DeepEval">
        At the root of your project directory install the TypeScript SDK:

        ```bash
        npm install deepeval-ts
        ```
      </Step>
      <Step title="Create an account">
        Navigate to [app.confident-ai.com](https://app.confident-ai.com) and create a free account. Once logged in, you'll be able to access your **project** API key from the dashboard.
      </Step>

      <Step title="Set API key as env variable">
        Set your project API key as an environment variable:

        ```bash
        export CONFIDENT_API_KEY="confident_us..."
        ```

        Or add it to your `.env` file:

        ```bash
        CONFIDENT_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
        ```
      </Step>
    </Steps>

<Tip>

Confident AI’s data lives in the US by default, but if you’re a customer with a data residency in the EU, you’ll need to run this command to point deepeval to use Confdient AI’s API endpoints on our EU servers and databases instead:

```bash
export CONFIDENT_BASE_URL="https://eu.api.confident-ai.com"
```

This step is only required if you’ve created an account in the EU data region.

</Tip>

## Next Steps

Now that you have Confident AI set up, the next section will guide you through **LLM evaluation in development**. This is where you'll learn to systematically test and improve your AI applications before deployment.

<Warning>
  No dataset yet? Start with [LLM Tracing](/docs/llm-tracing/introduction)
  instead to run ad-hoc evals and automatically build datasets from your
  production traces.
</Warning>
