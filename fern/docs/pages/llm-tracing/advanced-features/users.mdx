subtitle: Tracking user info in your traces for observability

## Overview

You can track user interactions with your LLM app by setting the `user_id` in a trace. This allows you to track things such as how much tokens each user is costing you, who interacted with your LLM app the most, etc.

        You can use the `update_current_trace` function to set the `user_id` within traces:

            ```python title="main.py" {13}
            from deepeval.tracing import observe, update_current_trace
            from openai import OpenAI
            
            client = OpenAI()
            
            @observe()
            def llm_app(query: str):
                res = client.chat.completions.create(
                    model="gpt-4o",
                    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": query}]
                ).choices[0].message.content
            
                update_current_trace(user_id="your-user-id")
                return res
            
            llm_app("Write me a poem.")
            ```

            The `user_id` can be any string, including the actual IDs of customers in your own database, or even their email addresses. Everything will be viewable and searched in the UI.

        You can use the `updateCurrentTrace` function to set the `userId` within traces:

            ```typescript title="index.ts" {10}
            import { observe, updateCurrentTrace } from '@deepeval-ts/tracing';
            import OpenAI from 'openai';

            const llmApp = async (query: string) => {
                const openai = new OpenAI();
                const res = await openai.chat.completions.create({
                    model: "gpt-4o",
                    messages: [{ role: "user", content: query }]
                })
                updateCurrentTrace({ userId: "your-user-id" });
                return res.choices[0].message.content;
            };

            const observedLlmApp = observe({fn: llmApp});
            observedLlmApp("Write me a poem.");
            ```

            The `userId` can be any string, including the actual IDs of customers in your own database, or even their email addresses. Everything will be viewable and searched in the UI.
