## Overview

You can run evaluations during LLM tracing, by running metrics on individual:

1. Spans,
2. Traces, and
3. Threads

For online evaluations, you can do this by providing the name of the **metric collection** you've created on Confident AI in the `@obesrve` decorators during tracing. For offline evaluations, you can call the `evaluate_thread` function to manually trigger an evaluation.

## Prerequisites

### Create Metric Collections

To enable referenceless metrics to run, you need to [create a metric collection](/docs/llm-evaluation/metrics/create-on-the-cloud) on Confident AI. Your metric collection will determine the set of metrics for you to run evaluations on.

If you're planning to run offline evals on threads, create a multi-turn metric collection, and vice versa. This is really important as you'll needs the metric collection names to match as you'll see in the next section.

<Warning>
Only **referenceless** metric you've enabled inside the metric collection are runnable upon tracing. For non-referenceless metrics, Confident AI will simply ignore them.

To recap, [referenceless metrics](/docs/concepts/metrics#referenceless-metrics) section, referenceless metrics are a special type of metric that can evaluate your LLM's performance without requiring reference data (like `expected_output` or `expected_tools`).
</Warning>

## Online Evaluations

Online evaluations refer to evals that are ran in real-time, as traces are ingested and sent to Confident AI.

### Spans

Simply provide the name of the metric collection to tell Confident AI the specify set of referenceless metrics you wish to run in the `@observe` decorator.

You'll also need to use `update_current_span` with an `LLMTestCase` at runtime to actually trigger an online evaluation on the server-side:

    <CodeBlock>
    ```python title="main.py" {7, 16}
    from deepeval.test_case import LLMTestCase
    from deepeval.tracing import observe, update_current_span
    from openai import OpenAI

    client = OpenAI()

    @observe(metric_collection="My Collection")
    def llm_app(query: str) -> str:
        res = client.chat.completions.create(
            model="gpt-4o",
            messages=[
                {"role": "user", "content": query}
            ]
        ).choices[0].message.content

        update_current_span(test_case=LLMTestCase(input=query, actual_output=res))
        return res

    llm_app("Write me a poem.")
    ```
    </CodeBlock>
    </Tab>
    <Tab title="Js/TypeScript">
    <CodeBlock>
    ```typescript title="index.ts" {5,13}
    import { observe, updateCurrentSpan } from '@deepeval-ts/tracing';

    const generate = async (prompt: string): Promise<string> => {
    updateCurrentSpan({
        test_case: new LLMTestCase({input=prompt, actualOutput=fake_output})
    })
    return "LLM response";
    }

    const observedGenerate = observe(
        type="llm",
        model: "gpt-4",
        metricCollection="My Collection",
        fn: generate,
    );
    ```
    </CodeBlock>
    </Tab>

</Tabs>

The `metricCollection` argument is an optional strings that determines which metrics in your online metric collection will be ran for this current span.

<Tip>
  Supplying a metric name in `metrics` that doesn't exist or isn't activated on
  Confident AI will result in it failing silently. If metrics aren't showing up
  on the platform, make sure the names align perfectly. (PS. Watch out for
  trailing spaces!)
</Tip>

If you specify a `metricCollection` list but don't update your current span with the sufficient test case parameters for metric execution, it will simply show up as an error on Confident AI, and won't block or cause issues in your code.

### Traces

Running evals on traces are akin to running [end-to-end evals](/docs/llm-evaluation/end-to-end-evals), where you disregard the performance of individual spans within the trace and treat your application as a black-box.

<Tip>
  You can run online evals on both traces and spans at the same time.
</Tip>

Similar to evals for spans, you would also provide a `metricCollection` name, but this time call the `update_current_trace()` function instead:

<Tabs>
    <Tab title="Python">
    <CodeBlock>
    ```python title="main.py" {7, 16}
    from deepeval.test_case import LLMTestCase
    from deepeval.tracing import observe, update_current_trace
    from openai import OpenAI

    client = OpenAI()

    @observe(metric_collection="My Collection")
    def llm_app(query: str) -> str:
        res = client.chat.completions.create(
            model="gpt-4o",
            messages=[
                {"role": "user", "content": query}
            ]
        ).choices[0].message.content

        update_current_trace(test_case=LLMTestCase(input=query, actual_output=res))
        return res

    llm_app("Write me a poem.")
    ```
    </CodeBlock>
    </Tab>
    <Tab title="Js/TypeScript">
    <CodeBlock>
    ```typescript title="index.ts" {5,13}
    import { observe, updateCurrentTrace } from '@deepeval-ts/tracing';

    const generate = async (prompt: string): Promise<string> => {
    updateCurrentTrace({
        test_case: new LLMTestCase({input=prompt, actualOutput=fake_output})
    })
    return "LLM response";
    }

    const observedGenerate = observe(
        type="llm",
        model: "gpt-4",
        metricCollection="My Collection",
        fn: generate,
    );
    ```
    </CodeBlock>
    </Tab>

</Tabs>

Also note that unlike evals on spans, the `metricCollection` **MUST BE DEFINED** at the top-level/root span level. You can call `update_current_trace` anywhere in your observed application though.

## Offline Evaluations

Offline evaluations refer to evals that are ran **retrospectively**, after traces are ingested into Confident AI.

### Threads

All threads are offline evaluations because you should only run evals on threads once a multi-turn interaction has completed.

Since it is impossible for Confident AI to automatically know whether a multi-turn conversation has completed or not, you'll have to trigger an offline evaluation using the `evaluate_thread()` method **ONLY AFTER** once you're certain a conversation has completed:

<CodeBlock>
```python title="main.py" {16, 24}
from openai import OpenAI
from deepeval.tracing import observe, update_current_trace, evaluate_thread

client = OpenAI()
your_thread_id = "your-thread-id"

@observe()
def llm_app(query: str):
res = client.chat.completions.create(
model="gpt-4o",
messages=[
{"role": "user", "content": query}
]
).choices[0].message.content

    update_current_trace(thread_id=your_thread_id, input=query, output=res)
    return res

if **name** == "**main**":
user_query = input("💬 Enter your prompt: ")
response = llm_app(user_query, true)
print(f"\n🤖 Response:\n{response}")

evaluate_thread(thread_id=your_thread_id, metric_collection="Collection Name")
```
</CodeBlock>

You can also use `a_evaluate_thread`, the `async` version of `evaluate_thread()`:

<CodeBlock>
```python title="main.py"
from deepeval.tracing import evaluate_thread

a_evaluate_thread(thread_id=your_thread_id, metric_collection="Collection Name")
```
</CodeBlock>

You **MUST** [set the `input`/`output`](/docs/llm-tracing/tracing-features/input-output) of individual traces in a thread for multi-turn evaluations to work. To recap, DeepEval uses the `input` of a trace as the `"user"` role content and the `output` of a trace as the `"assistant"` role content as turns in your thread.

<Warning>
  If you don't set the `input` and/or `output`, Confident AI will have nothing
  in your thread to evaluate.
</Warning>

You can also set the retrieval context and tools called (if any) for each assistant/AI turn as part of the `output` setting, which would allow you to see the context of which an LLM generation was invoked in:

<CodeBlock>
```python title="main.py" {8}
from deepeval.test_case import ToolCall
from deepeval.tracing import TurnContext

update_current_trace(
thread_id=your_thread_id,
output=res,
turnContext=TurnContext(
retrieval_context=["..."], # optional list of strings
tools_called=[ToolCall(...)] # optional list of tools called
)
)

```
</CodeBlock>

### Trace

Although less common since you can run online evals on traces, you can also run **single-turn**, offline evals on trace retrospectively:

<CodeBlock>
```python title="main.py"
from deepeval.tracing import evaluate_trace

evaluate_trace(trace_uuid=<your-trace-uuid>, metric_collection="Collection Name")
```

</CodeBlock>

<Tip>
  The asynchronous version, `a_evaluate_trace` is also available for traces.
</Tip>

Note that your trace **must already contain** the necessary test case parameters as you cannot update the test case parameters using the `evaluate_trace` function.

### Span

The same offline evals can also be ran in the same say for spans:

<CodeBlock>
```python title="main.py"
from deepeval.tracing import evaluate_span

evaluate_span(span_uuid=<your-span-uuid>, metric_collection="Collection Name")

```
</CodeBlock>

<Tip>
The asynchronous version, `a_evaluate_span` is also available for spans.
</Tip>

Remember, the metric collection you provide must be a **single-turn** one.

## Examples

### Trace and span evals


**Quick quiz:** Given the code below, will Confidnet AI run online evaluations on the trace using metrics in `"Collection 2"` or `"Collection 1"`?

<CodeBlock>
```python title="main.py"
from deepeval.tracing import observe, update_current_span, update_current_trace

@observe(metric_collection="Collection 1")
def outer_function():
    @observe(metric_collection="Collection 2")
    def inner_function():
        update_current_span(test_case=...)
        update_current_trace(test_case=...)
```

</CodeBlock>

**Answer:** This will run `"Collection 1"` for traces, and `"Collection 2"` for spans.

This is because in this example:

1. When `outer_function` starts, it creates the "outer" span
2. When `inner_function` is called, it creates the "inner" span on top
3. Any calls to `update_current_span()` during `inner_function`'s execution will update the "inner" span, not the "outer" one
4. Any calls to `update_current_trace()` during any point inside `outer_function` will update the entire trace and online evals for traces **MUST BE SET** on the root level span.

### Thread and trace evals

**Quick quiz:** Given the code below, will Confident AI run online evaluations on the thread using metrics in `"Collection 2"` or `"Collection 1"`?

<CodeBlock>
```python title="main.py"
from deepeval.tracing import observe, update_current_trace, evaluate_thread

your_thread_id = "your-thread-id"

@observe(metric_collection="Collection 1")
def outer_function():
update_current_trace(thread_id=your_thread_id, test_case=...)

evaluate_thread(thread_id=your_thread_id, metric_collection="Collection 2")

```
</CodeBlock>

**Answer:** This will **NOT** run `"Collection 1"` or `"Collection 2"`, because neither the `input` or `output` has been specified in `update_current_trace`. This means Confident AI will have no turns to evaluate using metrics in your metric collection.

<Warning>
Note that setting the `test_case` for a trace has no bearing on the `input` and `output`.
</Warning>
```
