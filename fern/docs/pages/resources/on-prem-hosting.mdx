Confident AI can be self-hosted in your organization's infrastructure through a containerized deployment. This deployment model ensures that **no data ever leaves your data center**, providing enhanced security and compliance for organizations with strict data governance requirements.

Our self-hosted solution includes enterprise **Single Sign-On (SSO)** for secure and seamless authentication.

## Deployment Process

The self-hosting deployment process consists of the following steps:
