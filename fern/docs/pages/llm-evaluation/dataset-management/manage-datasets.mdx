## Overview

A dataset, single or multi-turn one, is a list of goldens and forms the basis of any evaluation workflow in development. In this section, you'll learn to manipulate goldens in datasets, including:

- Uploading goldens via CSV on the platform
- Build an automated golden ingestion pipline via the Evals API
- Assiging different team members to review and finalize goldens

<Tip>
  If you haven't already, you should get yourself familiarized with [what are
  goldens.](/llm-evaluation/core-concepts/test-cases-goldens-datasets#goldens)
</Tip>

If you haven't already, create one under **Project** > **Datasets**:

## Golden Structure

Understanding the golden structure is essential before uploading your data. Goldens are the building blocks of datasets, and their structure differs slightly between single-turn and multi-turn evaluations:

<Tabs>

<Tab title="Single-Turn">

| Field               | Type            | Description                                                            |
| ------------------- | --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Input               | Text            | **Required.** The input query that will be used to invoke your AI app. |
| Expected Output     | Text            | The ideal output for a given input.                                    |
| Context             | List of text    | Static supporting context relevant to your use case.                   |
| Expected Tools      | List of tools   | The ideal list of tools that should be called.                         |
| Additional Metadata | Key-value pairs | Custom metadata for generating test cases.                             |
| Comments            | Text            | Any notes or comments about this golden.                               |

</Tab>

<Tab title="Multi-Turn">

| Field               | Type            | Description                                                               |

| Scenario            | Text            | **Required.** The circumstances under which the conversation takes place. |
| Expected Outcome    | Text            | The desired, ideal outcome for the given scenario.                        |
| User Description    | Text            | Description of the user interacting with your AI app.                     |

<Warning>
  Avoid pre-populating Actual Output, Retrieval Context, or Tools Called for
  single-turn goldens, and Turns for multi-turn goldens. These fields are meant
  to be populated dynamically during evaluation.
</Warning>

## Upload Goldens via CSV

You can upload both single and multi-turn goldens stored in CSVs to datasets. The fields that you will be mapping to CSV headers will just be slightly different.

## Assign Goldens For Annotation

You can also assign goldens to different team members for review and annotation.

## Delete Dataset

You can delete a dataset directly on the platform.

<Warning>
  This action cannot be undone. All goldens or conversational goldens in the
  dataset will be permanently deleted.
</Warning>

You can also do it programmatically through the Evals API.

```python main.py
from deepeval.dataset import EvaluationDataset

dataset = EvaluationDataset()
dataset.delete(alias="YOUR-DATASET-ALIAS")
```

</Tab>

<Tab title="Typescript" language="typescript">

```ts index.ts
import { EvaluationDataset } from "deepeval-ts";

const dataset = new EvaluationDataset();
dataset.delete({ alias: "YOUR-DATASET-ALIAS" });
```
