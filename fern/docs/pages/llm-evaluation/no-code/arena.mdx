## Overview

The Arena is a lightweight comparison tool for rapid comparison. It's ideal when you want to quickly see how different prompts, models, or AI connections perform — without setting up a full evaluation with datasets and metrics.

Use the Arena when you:

- Want to **compare prompt variations** to see which produces better outputs
- Need to **test a new model** against your current one before committing
- Are **iterating on a prompt** and want instant feedback
- Want to **demo differences** between configurations to stakeholders
- Don't yet have a dataset and want to rely on vibes

<Note>
  The Arena is for quick, qualitative comparisons. For evaluation with metrics
  and test datasets, perform [experiments](/docs/llm-evaluation/experiments)
  instead.
</Note>

## How It Works

The Arena lets you set up two or more "contestants" and run the same input through all of them simultaneously. Each contestant can be either a **Prompt** or **AI Connection** ([learn more](/docs/llm-evaluation/no-code-evals/quickstart#generating-ai-outputs)).

1. **Set up contestants** — configure two or more contestants to compare
2. **Enter your message(s)** — or existing prompts or AI connections
3. **Interpolate variables** - if any, enter the dynamic variables in your input
4. **Press Quick Run** — execute all contestants and view results side-by-side

You can mix and match — for example, compare a new prompt against your production AI Connection to see if it's ready for deployment.

## Using the Arena

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Arena">
    Go to **Project** > **Arena** from the sidebar.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure the Base Run">
    The base run is your starting point. Choose how it should generate outputs:

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="Prompt">
        1. Select a model provider (e.g., OpenAI) and model (e.g., gpt-4.1)
        2. Enter your prompt in the message composer — you can use variables like `{variable_name}`
        3. Optionally click **Settings** to configure model parameters

        <Tip>
          Use the **Select prompt...** dropdown to load a saved prompt from your Prompt Studio, or click **Save Prompt** to save your current prompt for later.
        </Tip>
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="AI Connection">
        1. Select an existing AI Connection from the dropdown
        2. Optionally associate prompts with the connection
        3. Click **Update AI Connection** to save any changes
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Comparison Runs">
    Click **Add Contestant** to add as many comparison runs as you need. Each contestant is independently configured — you can choose either a prompt or an AI Connection for each one.

    Common comparison setups:
    - **Prompt vs Prompt** — compare different prompt variations on the same model
    - **Model vs Model** — compare the same prompt across different models
    - **Prompt vs AI Connection** — test a new prompt against your production system

  </Step>

{" "}

<Step title="Set Variable Values">
  If your prompts contain variables, expand the **Variables** panel at the
  bottom to provide values. These values will be interpolated into all prompts
  before execution.
</Step>

  <Step title="Run the Comparison">
    You have two options:

    - **Quick Run** — immediately execute all contestants and view results inline
    - **Run as Experiment** — run the comparison as a tracked experiment for more detailed analysis

    Results appear below each contestant, allowing you to compare outputs side-by-side.

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Tips for Comparisons

- **Test one variable at a time** — change only the prompt OR the model between contestants to isolate what's causing differences
- **Use realistic inputs** — test with inputs that represent your actual use cases
- **Try edge cases** — compare how different configurations handle unusual or challenging inputs
- **Save winning prompts** — when you find a prompt that works well, save it to Prompt Studio for use in evaluations

## Next Steps

Once you've found a configuration that works (🎉), take it to the next level — run a full experiment with a dataset to get statistically meaningful results.
