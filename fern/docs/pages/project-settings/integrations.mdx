You can connect to your workspaces by setting up integrations to get notifications in slack, discord, email, or teams whenever an evaluation is completed. This works by selecting your choice of integration before providing the necessary information for Confident AI to post notifications to.

<Note>
  Unless you want to receive notifications by email, it will be a webhook you'll
  have to provide for your selected integration of choice.

## Select Integration

Go to **Project Settings** > **Integrations** in your project space, and select the integration you wish in the integrations dropdown. The available integrations are:

- Slack (requires webhook URL, learn how to create one [here](https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks))
- Discord (requires webhook URL, learn how to create one [here](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668-Intro-to-Webhooks))
- Teams (requires webhook URL, learn how to create one [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/webhooks-and-connectors/how-to/add-incoming-webhook?tabs=newteams%2Cdotnet))
- Email

For any integrations that are not covered, email support@confident-ai.com.

## Configure Notification Events

<Launch>
  Currently, the only available notification event is "On Test Run End". For
  more events that you need, email support@confident-ai.com.
</Launch>

Toggle on or off the "On Test Run End" event depending on whether you wish to be notified whenever an evaluation completes on Confident AI. You'll still get a notification even if you run evaluations locally vis DeepEval.

Once you're done, click **Save**.
