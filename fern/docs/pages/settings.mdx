description: Configure and manage your project and organization settings on Confident AI
---

Confident AI provides comprehensive settings to help you configure your workspace exactly how you need it. Settings are organized into two categories based on their scope and impact.

## Overview

Settings in Confident AI are divided into two levels:

1. **Project Settings** — Configure settings that apply to a specific project
2. **Organization Settings** — Manage settings that apply across all projects in your organization

<Note>
  Teams focused on org-wide AI adoption—such as Centers of Excellence,
  innovation teams, or platform teams in large enterprises—will find
  **Organization Settings** particularly relevant. These settings help manage
  resources and governance for multiple AI teams across the company.
</Note>

## Project vs Organization

When you create an account on Confident AI, an **organization** and a **project** within that organization are automatically created for you. Each organization can have multiple **projects** and **users**.

- **Organization** — The top-level container for all your Confident AI resources. Subscription plans and billing are managed at the organization level.

- **Project** — A workspace where data and access permissions are isolated. All data (test cases, metrics, datasets, traces, etc.) is separated at the project level.
