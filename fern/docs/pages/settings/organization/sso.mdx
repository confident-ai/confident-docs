SSO lets your team sign in to Confident AI using their existing company accounts. Currently, self-serve SSO setup supports **SAML** only.

If you need a different protocol, reach out to support@confident-ai.com.

## Setting Up SAML SSO

Head to **Organization Settings** → **Settings** → **SSO** tab to get started.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select Protocol">Choose SAML from the dropdown.</Step>
  <Step title="Enter Domain">
    Enter your company's email domain (e.g., `yourcompany.com`). SSO will apply to users with email addresses on this domain—subdomains aren't included.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure your Identity Provider">
    Set up Confident AI as an application in your IdP (Okta, Azure AD, Google Workspace, etc.). Copy these values into your IdP:

    - Assertion Consumer Service (ACS) URL
    - Entity ID
    - Name ID Format (Email Address)

  </Step>
  <Step title="Provide your IdP metadata">
    After setting up the application in your IdP, it'll give you metadata to enter here:

    - Single Sign-On URL
    - Issuer/Entity ID
    - Certificate

  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify Domain and Activate SSO">
    Add the provided TXT record to your DNS settings to verify you own the domain. Once verified, SSO goes live.
  </Step>
</Steps>

After SSO is activated, users with matching email domains will be able to sign in through your identity provider.

<Warning>
  There's a known bug where domain verification can fail during self-served SSO.
  If you run into problems during setup, reach out to support@confident-ai.com.
</Warning>

## Revoking SSO

If you need to disable SSO, head to **Organization Settings** → **Settings** → **SSO** tab and click **Revoke SSO**. Users will go back to signing in with their email and password. Note that this setup cannot be undone.
