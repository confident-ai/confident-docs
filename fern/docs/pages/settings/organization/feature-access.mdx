Enable or disable features available to projects in your organization. This is useful for platform teams rolling out Confident AI to internal teams—you can start with a subset of features and gradually enable more as teams get comfortable with the platform.

Head to **Organization Settings** → **Settings** → **Advanced** tab to manage feature access.

## Available Features

You can toggle access to features in these categories:

- **Evaluate** — Test Runs, Datasets, Arena, Experiments, Prompt Studio
- **Observability** — Traces, Spans, Threads, Users
- **Human in the Loop** — Human Annotation, Annotation Queues
- **Red Teaming** — Threats, Risk Profile, Frameworks

Disabling a feature hides it from the UI for all projects in your organization.

<Note>
Disabling a feature does not prevent API access.
