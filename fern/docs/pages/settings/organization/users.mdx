description: Learn about organization user management

View and manage all users in your organization. This page shows each user's email, name, and organization role.

## Manging Users

To manage existing users:

1. Navigate to **Organization Settings** → **Team**
2. Use the search bar to find users by name or email
3. Click the three-dot menu (⋮) to manage a user

## Organization Roles

Each user has an organization-level role that determines what they can do across the organization:

- **Owner** — Full access to all organization settings and resources
- **Admin** — Access to billing and manging other users
- **Member** — Standard access to projects they've been invited to

<Note>
  Organization roles are separate from project roles. A user can be a "Member"
  at the organization level but still have "Owner" access within a specific
  project.
</Note>

## Inviting Users

To invite a new user to your organization, you need to [invite them to a specific project](/settings/project/team-members) first. Once they accept the invitation, they'll automatically become part of your organization.

<Warning>
  Currently, you cannot invite users from the Organization Settings page. User
  invitations happen at the project level.
</Warning>
