Team members invited to a project receive access to that specific project only—other projects within the same organization remain inaccessible.

## Invite Users

Go to **Project Settings** > **Team** and click **Invite Team Member**. Enter the email address and click **Send Invitation**.

All invited users are assigned the **Member** role by default. You can change their role after they join. See [Roles and Permissions](/docs/settings/project/roles-and-permissions) for details on available roles.

<Note>
  If the invited user doesn't receive an email for any reason (e.g. email went
  to spam), they can still join by logging in or creating an account with the
  email address they were invited with.
</Note>

## Accept an Invite

Invited users don't need an existing Confident AI account. They simply need to log in or sign up **with the email address they were invited with**, then accept the prompt to join.

<Warning>
  If the user already belongs to another organization, they will be removed from
  all existing projects and organizations to join yours.
</Warning>

## Remove Users

To remove a team member, go to **Project Settings** > **Team**, find the user, and click the delete icon next to their name.
