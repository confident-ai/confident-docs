Roles and permissions let you control what each team member can do within a project.

## Default Roles

Every project comes with three preset roles:

- **Owner** — Full access to all resources in the project.
- **Manager** — Can manage members and resources.
- **Member** — Read and write access to resources.

## Custom Roles

You can create custom roles to fit your team's needs. To create a new role:

1. Navigate to **Project Settings** → **Roles & Permissions**
2. Click **New Role**
3. Enter a name and description for the role
4. Assign a policy to the role
5. Click **Save**

Common custom roles include "Annotator" roles that only allow a certain group of users for read and write access to datasets.

## Custom Policies

Policies define the specific permissions a role has. Each permission controls access to a particular action, like `dataset:read`, `dataset:create`, `golden:update`, or `trace:delete`.

To create a custom policy:

1. Navigate to **Project Settings** → **Roles & Permissions**
2. Scroll to **Custom Policies** and click **New Policy**
3. Enter a name for the policy
4. Select the permissions you want to include
5. Click **Save**

Once created, you can assign your custom policy to any role.

<Tip>
  Custom roles are useful for creating specialized access levels—like an
  Annotator role that can only view and edit datasets, without access to traces
  or test runs.

## Permission Syntax

Permissions follow a `resource:action` format. For example, `dataset:read` grants read access to datasets, while `trace:evaluate` allows running evaluations on traces.

**Actions:**

- `create` — Create new resources
- `read` — View resources
- `update` — Modify existing resources
- `delete` — Remove resources
- `evaluate` — Run evaluations on the resource
- `assign` — Assign resources to users or queues

**Resources:**

- `dataset`, `golden` — Datasets and their goldens
- `metric`, `metric_collection` — Metric scores and collections
- `trace`, `span`, `thread` — Observability data
- `test_run`, `test_case`, `experiment` — Evaluation runs
- `prompt`, `prompt_version` — Prompts and their versions
- `annotation_queue`, `queue_item` — Annotation queues and their items
- `project_member` — Team member management

Not every resource will have all actions. For example, dataset doens't have `project_member`, while `annotation_queue` doesn't have `evaluate`. You can find the full list of permissions on the roles & permissions page.
