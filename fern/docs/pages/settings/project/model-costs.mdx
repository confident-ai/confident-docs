Model Costs lets you configure cost tracking for your LLM usage. This is useful for monitoring spending across different models and understanding cost breakdowns in your traces.

## Cost Priority

Model costs are applied in the following order of priority:

1. **Tracing API / DeepEval** — Costs explicitly set when logging traces take highest priority
2. **Custom Model Costs** — Costs you configure in project settings override pre-configured defaults
3. **Pre-configured Model Costs** — Fallback pricing for common models when no other cost is set

## Inherit Custom Model Pricing From Organization

Toggle this option to inherit model cost configurations from your organization settings. When enabled, organization-level model costs will override the pre-configured defaults for this project.

This is useful when you want to maintain consistent pricing across multiple projects without configuring each one individually.

## Custom Model Costs

Custom model costs let you define pricing for specific models or model patterns. These costs override pre-configured defaults but are themselves overridden by costs explicitly set via the tracing API or DeepEval.

To add a custom model cost:

1. Navigate to **Project Settings** → **Model Costs**
2. Click **Add Model Cost**
3. Enter a **Match Pattern** (e.g., `gpt-4.1`, `claude-*`, or `my-custom-model`)
4. Optionally select a **Provider** to restrict the cost rule to spans from that specific provider
5. Set the **Input Cost** per million token
6. Set the **Output Cost** per million tokens
7. Click **Save**

You only need either one of input or output cost.

<Tip>
  Use wildcard patterns (e.g., `gpt-4*`) to match multiple model variants with a
  single cost configuration.

| Field                  | Description                                              |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Match Pattern          | The model name or pattern to match against traced models |
| Provider               | Optional provider filter for the cost rule               |
| Input Cost / M Tokens  | Cost per million input tokens                            |
| Output Cost / M Tokens | Cost per million output tokens                           |

## Pre-configured Model Costs

Confident AI includes pre-configured costs for popular models from major providers. These serve as fallback pricing when no cost is set through the tracing API or custom model costs.

Pre-configured costs are available for:

- **OpenAI** — GPT-4, GPT-4o, GPT-3.5 Turbo, and other OpenAI models
- **Anthropic** — Claude 3.5, Claude 3, and other Anthropic models
- **Gemini** — Gemini Pro, Gemini Ultra, and other Google models

<Note>
  Pre-configured costs are updated periodically to reflect current provider
  pricing. For the most accurate cost tracking, consider setting custom costs or
  passing costs directly via the tracing API.
</Note>

You can search through pre-configured costs by model name to verify the pricing being used for your traces.
