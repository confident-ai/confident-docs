Set up alerts to notify you when certain events occur in your project. There are two types of alerts: **Event-based** alerts that trigger immediately when specific events occur, and **Scheduled** alerts that run on recurring intervals primarily for observability monitoring.

<Note>
  You'll need to [set up an integration](/docs/settings/project/integrations) to
  receive alerts. Connect your Slack, Discord, Teams, or email to receive
  notifications.

## Event-Based Alerts

Event-based alerts trigger immediately when specific events occur in your project. These are useful for staying informed about evaluation completions and other discrete events.

To configure event-based alerts:

1. Navigate to **Project Settings** → **Alerts**
2. Select the **Events** tab
3. Toggle on the alerts you want to receive
4. Click **Save**

### Available Event Alerts

| Alert                       | Description                                                  |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Notify on Test Run Complete | Get notified every time a test run completes in your project |

## Scheduled Alerts

Scheduled alerts (also called Custom Alert Rules) notify you on specific recurring events occurring in your project on custom schedules. These are primarily used for **observability alerting** on traces, spans, and threads.

To create a scheduled alert:

1. Navigate to **Project Settings** → **Alerts**
2. Select the **Scheduled** tab
3. Click **New Alert Rule**
4. Configure your alert conditions (e.g., trace count falls below a threshold)
5. Select your preferred schedule frequency
6. Click **Save**

### Schedule Frequencies

| Frequency        | Description                     |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Every 30 minutes | Check conditions twice per hour |
| Hourly           | Check conditions once per hour  |
| Daily            | Check conditions once per day   |
| Weekly           | Check conditions once per week  |
| Monthly          | Check conditions once per month |

### Example Use Cases

- **Trace volume monitoring** — Alert when the number of traces per hour falls below a threshold, indicating potential issues with your application or tracing setup
- **Error rate spikes** — Monitor for unusual increases in error rates across your spans
- **Performance degradation** — Track latency metrics and get notified when they exceed acceptable thresholds
