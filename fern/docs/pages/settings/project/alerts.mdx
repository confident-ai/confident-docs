Set up alerts to notify you when certain events occur in your project. This is especially useful for live monitoring use cases.

<Note>
  You'll need to [set up an integration](/settings/project/integrations) to
  receive alerts. Connect your Slack, Discord, email, or Teams channels to
  receive alerts.
