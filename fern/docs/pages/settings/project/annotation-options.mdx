Enable or disable different human annotation options for your project. These criteria are used **for all annotations** within your project on Confident AI.

<Tip>
  Disabling criteria helps reduce confusion for users or team members by
  limiting the annotation options shown in the UI.
</Tip>

## Configure Annotation Option

By default, both annotation systems are enabled:

- **Five Star Rating** — Rate responses on a 1-5 star scale
- **Thumbs Up/Down** — Simple binary feedback

You can disable either system (but not both) if you only want to use one. To configure annotation criteria:

1. Navigate to **Project Settings** → **Annotation Criteria**
2. Enable or disable the scoring system (5 star or thumbs up/down) you want to use
3. Click **Save** to apply your changes

<Note>
  Disabling a criteria only hides it from the UI—it does not delete existing
  annotations for that system. It also does not block API calls or cause
  existing integrations to error.
</Note>

## Custom Criteria

You can create custom annotation criteria tailored to your specific evaluation needs. By default, no custom criteria are configured.

To add a custom criteria:

1. Click **Add Custom Criteria**
2. Enter a unique name for the criteria
3. Select a criteria type (Five Star Rating or Thumbs Up/Down)
4. Click **Save**

To delete a custom criteria, click the trash icon next to the criteria you want to remove.
