## Configure Data Region

When using the [Evals API](/docs/api-reference/introduction) or some integrations that rely on [OpenTelemetry](/docs/integrations/opentelemetry), you'll need to change the base and OTEL endpoints:

```bash
export CONFIDENT_BASE_URL="https://eu.api.confident.com"
export CONFIDENT_OTEL_URL="https://eu.otel.confident-ai.com"
```

Or alternatively, you can run the `set-confident-region` command to switch to for example the EU region:

```bash
deepeval set-confident-region EU
```
