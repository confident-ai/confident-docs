## Dashing Into the New Year

TGIF! Thank god it's features, here's what we shipped this week:

New year, new dashboards! We've redesigned how you visualize your LLM performance with customizable views and smarter breakdowns. And while you're at it, you can now *take your security insights with you* as PDF reports.

### Added

- **Custom Dashboards** - Build your own views. Save them. Make them yours. Finally, analytics that fit how *you* work.
- **Dimension Breakdowns** - Slice and dice by model, environment, or any dimension. Compare apples to apples (or GPT-4 to Claude).
- **Risk Assessment Reports (PDF)** - Generate custom risk assessment reports from your red teaming runs and download them as shareable PDFs. Perfect for reviews, audits, and internal security discussions. (Keep it confidential)

### Changed

- **Fresh Dashboard Layout** - Everything's been reorganized for better flow. Less clicking, more insights.
- **Readable Timestamps** - Dates and times now look like actual dates and times. Revolutionary, we know.
