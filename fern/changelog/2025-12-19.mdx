## Compare and Contrast

TGIF! Thank god it's features, here's what we shipped this week:

This week is all about perspective. New comparison features let you see how your models stack up—across time, segments, or whatever you want to measure.

### Added

- **LLM Connection Config** - Fine-tune your LLM connections with custom parameters. Temperature, max tokens, you name it.
- **Comparison Mode** - Put two time periods side-by-side. See exactly what changed and when. Debugging regressions just got easier.
- **Filter Presets** - Save your favorite filter combos. One click to your most-used views.
