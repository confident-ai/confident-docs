## Let There Be Light (Mode)

TGIF! Thank god it's features, here's what we shipped this week:

Big week for visibility—both in your data and on your screen. We're launching 30+ additional Observatory graphs to surface insights, a Data Usage settings page for full transparency, and light mode is officially out of beta. Shine bright, friends.

### Added

- **Data Usage Settings Page** - Know thy data. A dedicated page to see exactly how your data is being used—because transparency isn't just a buzzword, it's a lifestyle.
- **Observatory Graphs** - Finally, charts that slap. Visualize your observability data, spot trends before they spot you, and look like a genius in your next standup.
- **Code Evals (Beta)** - G-Eval couldn't cut it? Write your own eval logic in code. We don't judge. Okay, technically we do—that's the whole point.
- **Multimodal Arena** - Let your vision-language models duke it out. Two models enter, one model leaves with bragging rights.
- **AI Connection Upgrades** - Tracing, list indexes key path, duplicate connections, max concurrency—the works. Your AI connections just got a glow-up.

### Changed

- **Light Mode Out of Beta** - Light mode is officially here to stay. Welcome to the bright side.
- **Faster Observatory Dashboards** - We gave our dashboards a double espresso. Load times are now unreasonably fast.
