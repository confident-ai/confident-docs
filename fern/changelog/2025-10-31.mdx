## Spooky Good Updates

TGIF! Thank god it's features, here's what we shipped this week:

It's Halloween and we've got treats, not tricks! Tool call streaming is here so you can watch your agents work in real-time, plus the prompt assistant just got a whole lot smarter.

### Added

- **Tool Call Streaming** - See your agent's tool calls as they happen. No more waiting for the final output to understand what went wrong.
- **Prompt Assistant Refactor** - Our AI helper for prompt engineering got a major upgrade. Better suggestions, faster responses.
- **Max Concurrent Evaluations** - Control how many evals run at once. Great for rate-limited APIs and not burning through your quota.

### Changed

- **Better Error Messages** - When things go wrong, you'll actually know why. Clearer errors across the platform.
