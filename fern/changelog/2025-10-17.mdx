## Dataset Your Sights Higher

TGIF! Thank god it's features, here's what we shipped this week:

Datasets just got an upgrade. Evaluate prompts directly from datasets and manage your LLM connections with a dedicated page.

### Added

- **Dataset Evaluate Prompts** - Run evaluations directly from your datasets. Select a prompt, pick your metrics, and go.
- **AI Connection Page** - A dedicated place to manage all your AI connections. See what's configured, test connections, and troubleshoot.
- **Prompt Version Labels** - Tag your prompt versions with custom labels. Production, staging, experimental—organize however you want.

### Changed

- **Smarter Project Fetcher** - Projects load faster and more reliably, especially for organizations with many projects.
