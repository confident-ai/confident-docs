## A Metric Ton of Updates

TGIF! Thank god it's features, here's what we shipped this week:

We're laying the groundwork for multimodal evaluation and making threads easier to navigate. Plus, more control over your time ranges because "last 7 days" isn't always what you need.

### Added

- **Multimodal Metrics** - Purpose-built metrics for vision-language models. Evaluate what your eyes (well, your model's eyes) can see.
- **Enhanced Thread View** - Follow conversations from start to finish. Every span, every trace, beautifully organized.

### Changed

- **Flexible Time Ranges** - Custom date windows are here. Pick any range. Go wild.
