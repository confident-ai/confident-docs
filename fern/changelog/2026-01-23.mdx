## Alert the Press, We're Going Multimodal

TGIF! Thank god it's features, here's what we shipped this week:

Big week! We're introducing alerts to keep you in the loop, shareable traces for collaboration, and multimodal support so your vision models don't feel left out.

### Added

- **Public Trace Links** - Share traces with anyone via a public link. Perfect for debugging with teammates or showing off to stakeholders.
- **Scheduled Alerts** - Set thresholds, get notified. Never let a regression slip through unnoticed again.
- **Multimodal Evaluations** - Images + text? We can evaluate that now. Test your vision-language models with confidence.
- **Evaluation Queue** - Large eval jobs now queue up nicely instead of timing out. Go big or go home.

### Changed

- **Snappier Dashboards** - Graphs load faster. Like, noticeably faster. You're welcome.
