TGIF! Thank god it's features, here's what we shipped this week:

New model support and Arena improvements! Gemini joins the party, and the Arena just got more flexible with variable mapping.

### Added

- **Gemini Support** - Google's Gemini models are now available for evaluations. Test your prompts against the latest from Google.
- **Arena Variable Mapping** - Map your test case variables to prompt placeholders. Makes testing prompt variations a breeze.
- **Arena Endpoints** - New API endpoints for programmatic Arena access. Automate your prompt testing workflows.

### Changed

- **Improved Model Selection** - Cleaner UI for picking which model to use. All your options, clearly organized.
- **Better Trace Display** - Trace details now render more cleanly, especially for long outputs.
