### Added

- **Duplicate Datasets** - Clone any dataset with one click. Perfect for creating variations or backing up before big changes.
- **Better Invitation UX** - Accepting team invitations is now smoother. New users get a clear onboarding flow instead of a confusing redirect.

### Changed

- **Dashboard Reorganization** - Dashboards now live under Home for easier navigation. One less click to your metrics.
- **Multiple Dashboards** - Create different views for different needs. One for prod, one for staging, one for "what happened last night?"
