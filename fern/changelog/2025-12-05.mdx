## 100 Ways to Evaluate

TGIF! Thank god it's features, here's what we shipped this week:

Why limit yourself to one LLM provider? With LiteLLM integration, you can now evaluate using 100+ providers. OpenAI, Anthropic, Cohere, local models—if LiteLLM supports it, so do we.

### Added

- **LiteLLM Gateway** - One integration, 100+ providers. Evaluate with whatever model you want, wherever it lives.
- **Custom Graphs** - Build visualizations that actually match your KPIs. Your metrics, your way.

### Changed

- **Optional Tags** - Tags are now optional for evaluations. Less friction, faster setup. Just run the thing.
