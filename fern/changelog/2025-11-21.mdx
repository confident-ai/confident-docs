## Lit-erally Amazing

TGIF! Thank god it's features, here's what we shipped this week:

LiteLLM joins the party! Evaluate with 100+ model providers through a single integration. Plus, better annotation tools to help you understand your data.

### Added

- **LiteLLM Support** - Connect your LiteLLM gateway and evaluate with OpenAI, Anthropic, Cohere, local models, and more. One config, endless possibilities.
- **Inherit Model Credentials** - Projects can now inherit AI credentials from the organization level. Set it once, use it everywhere.
- **Annotation Upgrades** - New annotation UI with better organization. Add notes, categorize results, and track quality over time.
- **Dataset Editor Improvements** - Edit your golden datasets inline. No more export-edit-import dance.

### Changed

- **Better Filter Persistence** - Your filter settings now stick around between sessions. Less clicking, more analyzing.
