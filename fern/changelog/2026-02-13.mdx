## More Than Meets the AI

TGIF! Thank god it's features, here's what we shipped this week:

Transformers (Beta) are here and they're _truly_ more than meets the AI. Reshape your traced data before evaluation—because not every trace deserves the full spotlight. Meanwhile, Prompt Studio just got a serious _commit_-ment upgrade with git-style versioning. Love is in the diff this Valentine's weekend.

### Added

- **Transformers (Beta)** - The biggest release this week, and it's more than meets the eye. Write custom code to transform your traced data—including individual spans—before evaluation. Don't want the whole trace? No problem. Cherry-pick exactly what matters.
- **Transformers on AI Connections** - Got a JSON blob coming back from your model? Negative indexes on a list? Transformers let you parse and wrangle AI connection outputs however you need. Your data, your rules.
- **Prompt Commits** - Every change to your prompt now creates a commit. Full history, no more guessing what changed or when. It's `git log` for your prompts, and it's _beautiful_.
- **Prompt Versions** - Tag any commit as a version—think of them like releases. You can label what matters and ship with confidence. Semver fans, rejoice.

### Changed

- **Git-Based Prompt Studio** - Prompt Studio is leaning hard into the git workflow. Commits, versions, diffs—everything you love about version control, now for your prompts. We're committing to this direction. (Pun intended.)
