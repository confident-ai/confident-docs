## On Cloud Nine

TGIF! Thank god it's features, here's what we shipped this week:

Azure fans, GCP enthusiasts—we see you. This week we're bringing the clouds to Confident AI so you can evaluate using your own infrastructure.

### Added

- **Azure OpenAI Support** - Connect your Azure deployment and run evals without leaving your cloud comfort zone.
- **GCP Vertex AI Integration** - Drop in your service account key and you're off to the races with Google's models.
- **Top-K Filtering** - Show me the top 10. Or bottom 5. Or whatever K your heart desires.

### Changed

- **Faster Dashboards** - We optimized the heck out of our aggregation layer. Graphs now load before you finish your sip of coffee.
- **Live Evaluation Progress** - Watch your evals run in real-time with streaming progress updates. It's oddly satisfying.
