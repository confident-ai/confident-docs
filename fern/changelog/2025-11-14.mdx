## Docker? I Hardly Know Her

TGIF! Thank god it's features, here's what we shipped this week:

Going on-prem? We've made self-hosting a breeze with proper Docker support. Plus, conversational evaluation just got smarter with multi-turn golden datasets.

### Added

- **Docker Support** - Full Dockerfile and docker-compose setup for on-premise deployments. Spin up Confident AI anywhere.
- **Conversational Goldens** - Create multi-turn conversation datasets. Test your chatbots with realistic back-and-forth dialogues.
- **Auth On-Prem** - Self-hosted deployments now support the same auth features as cloud. Enterprise-ready, wherever you run.

### Changed

- **Simpler Environment Config** - Streamlined environment variables for easier deployment. Less config, more evaluating.
