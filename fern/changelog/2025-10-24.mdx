## Stream Team

TGIF! Thank god it's features, here's what we shipped this week:

Real-time just got more real. Streaming experiments mean you can watch evaluations progress live, and experiment edge cases are now handled gracefully.

### Added

- **Streaming Experiments** - Watch your evaluation progress in real-time. See results as they come in, not just when everything's done.
- **Multiple Winners Support** - Experiments can now have multiple winners (or no winner). Because sometimes it's a tie.

### Changed

- **Experiment Results Handling** - Better handling of edge cases when experiments have unusual outcomes.
- **Runtime Environment Config** - Cleaner configuration for different deployment environments.
